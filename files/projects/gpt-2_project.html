          The objective of this project is to implement a very basic front-end
          in Google Cloud with which to interact with the Open-AI NLP model,
          GPT-2. To deploy the model quickly and efficiently in GCP, a Docker
          container deployed in Google Cloud Run will be used.
        </p>
        <h3>How to implement GPT-2?</h3>
        <p>
          To implement this model, we will use a pre-trained version of the same
          present in the popular NLP library
          <a href="https://github.com/huggingface">HuggingFace</a>. However, in
          HuggingFace we can find multiple versions of the GPT-2 model itself:
          "gpt2", "gpt2-xl", "distilgpt2", "gpt2-medium", etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          In principle we could use
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/models?search=GPT2">any of them</a>.
          However, since GCP proposes a maximum of available memory in the case
          of using it for free (2 GiB when this project was made), we will opt
          for the lighter version of all of them:
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2">distillgpt2</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this version of GPT2 will not offer such satisfactory
          results as the full version could generate, it serves us to develop
          our app and deploy it in GCP. If in the future this memory capacity
          is extended, it would be quite easy to import a different NLP model
          and load it again thanks to the next great aspect of this project:
          Docker containers.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a container?</h3>
        <p>
          A container is, according to Docker itself:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>"A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and
          all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from
          one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a
          lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes
          everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools,
          system libraries and settings."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why, thanks to the containers, we can easily abstract our
          code between different operating systems. In a fast and simple way.
          All the necessary information to execute our code is inside the
          container itself, so we only need a programming environment capable
          of deploying containers. And this is where Google Cloud Run comes in.
        </p>
        <h3>Cloud Run</h3>
        <p>
          Cloud Run is a Google Cloud tool that allows us to quickly and easily
          deploy our containerized projects. With a couple of simple steps, we
          can create our Cloud Run service, configure it according to our needs
          and deploy a container stored in Google Cloud through Container
          Registry.
        </p>
        <h3>Code</h3>
        <p>
          The code for this app is quite simple (see it on
          <a href="https://github.com/marsolmos/gpt2-text-generator">Github</a>).
          It has a Dockerfile needed to create the Docker image that we will
          later display in Cloud Run, a <i>get_model.py</i> file with which we
          will download the HuggingFace NLP model that we will use and our app
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is basically a Flask application (<i>app.py</i>), in which we
          will have different callbacks with which we will render our front-end
          (based on HTML, CSS and JS) and with which we will call our text
          prediction function: <i>generate.py</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in <i>generate.py</i> where we will load the tokenizer and the
          NLP model downloaded from <i>distilgpt2</i>, and we will pass to both
          of them the input that the user enters in the text box that he will
          find in the HTML front-end in the form of a python function that we
          will call <i>generate()</i>. The result of this function will be the
          prediction given by the model for this input, and it will be returned
          to the front-end through the <i>main.js</i> script.
        </p>
        <h3>Deploying in Cloud Run</h3>
        <p>
          Once we have downloaded the model locally by running the get_model.py
          script in a terminal, and we have checked in our localhost (in this
          case, through port 8080) that the app works correctly, it's time to
          generate our container and upload it to Google Cloud Registry.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do this, it is essential to first have a GCP account with a
          project created in it and the Cloud Registry and Cloud Run services
          enabled for it. An easy and simple way to upload this container to the
          Cloud Registry is through the command line once we have correctly
          installed Google Cloud SDK on our computer (more info on
          <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart">how to do it here</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to generate the container and upload it to GCR we will only have
          to execute the following commands in our terminal
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-docker">
          # Build docker container
          docker build --tag container-tag-name:latest .

          # Check in 8080 port that everything is working
          docker run --env=.env -p 8080:8080 container-tag-name

          # Push container to Google Cloud Registry
          docker tag container-tag-name:latest eu.gcr.io/container-tag-name/container-tag-name:latest
          docker push eu.gcr.io/container-tag-name/container-tag-name:latest
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Once the container is completely uploaded to GCR, we only have to
          create a new Cloud Run service in our project, specifying what we
          want to use:
        </p>
        <ul id="project-detail-list">
          <li>2 CPU</li>
          <li>2 GiB allocated memory</li>
          <li>Allow unauthenticated invocations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In our project control panel, we can see the progress of the
          deployment of our container. Once it has been completed, we can see
          in the upper right a URL where the container has been deployed. If
          we click on it, we will be redirected to a new page where our app
          should load normally. However, when we try to write text so that it
          returns predictions it will not do anything and will remain static.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is due to the HOST configuration in the app. To correct it, we
          will have to copy the address of the app itself
          (i.e. <i>https://gpt2-text-generator-app-hwe7ciavyq-ew.a.run.app/</i>)
          and create a new <i>HOST</i> variable in the Cloud Run service. To do
          this, we will return to the main panel and click on the edit service
          option. Once there, we will click on
          <i>Variables - Create new variable</i>. The name that we will assign
          to it will be <i>HOST</i> and the value of it will be the one of
          the URL of the app itself that we had copied previously (including
          <i>"https://"</i>). After this, we will save our changes and the app
          will be displayed again allowing, this time, the prediction function
          to work properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Further Work</h3>
        <p>
          This project is especially versatile and interesting in that it
          allows. On the one hand, recycle much of its code to create other
          front-ends and containerize them to deploy apps with ML in the Google
          Cloud itself quickly and easily, allowing to focus on improving the
          model itself, and not on its deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, this project allows even multiple improvements,
          such as implementing more accurate NLP models than distilgpt2, or
          allowing the app to recognize multiple languages, since right now it
          only predicts in English.
