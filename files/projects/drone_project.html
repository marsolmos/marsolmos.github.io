        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          During my Erasmus studies at The Netherlands, I participated in the DBF
          Minor <i>(Design, Build & Fly)</i> at HvA. There, we were asked to
          build a drone within teams up to five people according to our customer
          requirements, and following a series of deadlines fixed by himself.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the decisions regarding the design process rely on
          successfully accomplishing the mission: the UAV has to fly the DBF
          letters, within a predetermined airfield; drop a payload, in a preset
          specific location and without suffering any damage; it has to be
          safely hand-launched and fly in automatic mode, including safe landing.
        </p>
        <h3>Drone Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Besides, the fact that the airplane must fulfill a list of requirements
          has settled many other design outcomes during this phase. Otherwise,
          the airplane won't have clearance to fly. There are 2 types of
          requisites: the DBF Minor requisites stated by the HVA, such as a
          maximum weight of 4 kg or a maximum wingspan of 2 meters; and the
          CS-23 requirements stated by EASA, like the maximum limit and ultimate
          loads the wing must withstand. All these are conditions sine qua non
          to fly the mission.
        </p>
        <h3>Design and Construction Keypoints</h3>
        <p>
          Some of the most relevant design choices have been: a trapezoidal wing,
          due to the lift distribution that this shape generates; a Clark-Y
          profile, due to its lift to drag ratio and stall entry characteristics;
          a T-tail, which reduces the chance of damage during landing; a
          smoothly-curved fuselage shape with a low lateral surface, improving
          the aircraft's stability and making it possible to comfortably install
          all the components inside the plane; a dropping mechanism, including a
          drag parachute that reduces the chance of damage of the payload; and
          finally, a landing gear, located underneath the propeller in order to
          protect it and the rest of the drone during landing or a crash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The choices of the materials have been also constrained by the mission
          requirements. Since the wing skin must contain composite materials, it
          will be built with glass fiber. lts structure will be made out of
          carbon fiber and wood. The tail and the fuselage's skin will contain
          the same materials excluding the carbon fiber, due to requirements
          regarding weight and cost limits. The landing gear will be constructed
          in stainless steel to provide suficient strength. Since the nose cone
          is a hard-to-build shape, it will be 3D printed in PLA plastic.
          Finally, the control surfaces of the aircraft will be made of foam and
          laminated in glass fiber in order to keep them as light and strong as
          possible and easily replaceable. The production methods will include
          laser-cutting, 3D printing and composite materials laminates.
          Nevertheless, there are parts of the drone that will be bought and not
          built. Including parts made of wood, carbon fiber or stainless steel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aircrafts’ flight capabilities were tested in the Merlin Simulator.
          After achieving a stable flying UAV after several tests, the data of
          the parameters determining its flight performance such as the turning
          radius or stall speed among others, will be exported from the
          simulations and compared to the theoretical results obtained.
        </p>
        <h3>Mission Execution & Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          The mission execution was located at the NLR (Netherlands Aerospace
          Centre) in Emmeloord. They execute national and international
          assignments in the field of aircraft development, specially those
          regardings with UAVs. On Monday 11th of June the mission execution of
          the DBF minor took place under NLR's responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the official mission, the aircraft had to be tested during the
          pre-mission (test) flight. This flight was for NLR to test if
          everything was working like it should and to minimize the chance of
          something going wrong during the mission flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the aircraft could take off, the signals were tested on the
          ground. This was done by taking the transmitter about 500 meters away
          from the aircraft and then the staff members of NLR checked if the
          control services were still working from a distance. Everything still
          worked, so this aircraft could fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a correctly performed take-off, the aircraft had a stable
          flight. During this flight, the maximum speed, climb angle and
          stability were tested and measured by the flight instruments. Then,
          after it flew for about 5 minutes, the engine support of the drone
          broke off. After breaking off, the propeller hit one side of the
          landing gear and those parts fell together with the bottom part of the
          nose cone and the engine. Even though those parts fell off mid-air,
          the aircraft was able to make a safe landing afterwards without any
          more damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cause of this error was the weakness of the 3D-printed part which
          held the engine and propeller. The thrust was too high, and the
          density of the 3D-printed part was too low, which caused a tear in
          this engine connection. Due tO "the crash", this aircraft was not able
          to fly the mission. That's why the aircraft has not flown in automatic
          mode and the package with the parachute wasn't dropped either. Also,
          the shape of the DBF letters weren't flown in the air. Although, there
          was no mission flight, several tests were executed during the test
          flight. The data of these tests was downloaded and was used and
          processed in the evaluation report.
        </p>
        <h3>Accident Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          After 270 seconds of the test flight, the engine suddenly detaches
          from the drone's body. The first conclusion is simple: the 3D printed
          engine mount broke, triggering the contact of the propeller at maximum
          RPM speed with the landing gear that instantly provoked the complete
          detachment and wires disconnection of the engine from the rest of the
          fuselage.
        </p>
        <p>
          What caused this failure that forced the drone to perform an emergency
          landing, avoiding to perform the mission? First, a component failure
          was considered as the issue: the metallic part of the engine that
          should be screwed to the engine mount was slightly bent due to hard
          landing in a previous DBF mission. This component could note be
          replaced on time and the drone had to fly with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, after meticulously analyzing the fissure the main
          problem was enlightened: the 3D printed engine mount was not hard
          enough. Despite that it was a 3D printed piece instead of a wood
          piece, the reason of the crack wasn't the weakness of the PLA plastic,
          but the fact that this piece was a TEST part: its filling density was
          only 5%, unacceptably below the correct calculated value: 75%.
        </p>
        <p>
          These "test parts" were printed to check the fitting and sizing of the
          3D printed parts before printing the final piece saving time and money
          in case of failure. In this case, epoxy gluing the test piece (by
          mistake) to the fuselage made it impossible to unmount the part and
          install the correct one for the flight day on time.
        </p>
        <h3>Aircraft's Flight Dynamics</h3>
        <p>
          Although there was no mission flight, the previous test flight gave
          enough data to analyze the aircraft’s final performance, comparing it
          to the calculated values during the design phase. The main aspects
          analyzed were:
        </p>
        <ul id="project-detail-list">
          <li>
            <u><strong>Maximum Speed in Level Flight:</strong></u>
            Analyzing the maximum airspeed data obtained for stable flight, it
            can be found a value of <i>22.3 m/s</i> in the speed array. This
            value is almost the same as the theoretically calculated one of
            <i>22 m/s</i>, and to the one obtained with the Merlin Simulator
            for stable flight, <i>21 m/s</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><strong>Maximum Climb Angle:</u></strong>
            The maximum climb angle reached by the drone was 41.7 degrees and it
            was done after 245 seconds of flight. During the Merlin Simulator
            tests, it could be seen that the maximum climb angle sustained by
            the drone was 50 degrees, for at least 1 minute, representing a 16%
            deviation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><strong>Turning Radius:</u></strong>
            The position data of the GPS module was exported to a <i>.KMZ</i>
            fiel to visualize in <i>Google Earth</i> the whole flight path. The
            turning radius was determined using the measurements tools that the
            program includes. Hence, the minimum turning radius that the
            aircraft was able to realize was 7.31 m, with a roll of 44.3
            degrees and alpha 23 degrees. The theoretical value for this case
            would be around 5.5 m. Although this value represent a deviation of
            30% with the real one, the difference in absolite value is only 2
            meters. Given the dimensions of the mission area, it seems very
            clear that it wouldn't have been a problem for the aircraft to make
            closed turns to draw the DBF letters in the sky if the engine mount
            wouldn't have failed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Although this project was not without its problems, it was a success.
          Despite not being  able to fiy in the flight of the mission, the
          aircraft could at least fly for about 5 minutes  without any problems
          and according to the design calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The production methods used were a hit and miss. Some methods were
          very poor due to not using the workshops correctlly. This caused big
          delays in the construction process. h,moreover, the design was also
          very complex, which added even more delays in the construction process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission execution ended with mixed feelings, because the aircraft
          flew on one side but on the other side the actual mission flight could
          not be performed due to the  emergency landing. The structural failure
          that occurred was caused by a weak PLA parte that was used by mistake
          on the flight. The filling density was way too low, and this should
          have been checked.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the flight dynamics most data matched the calculated performance
          and Merlin Simulator's data. The flight dynamics also show that the
          aircraft would have been able to fly the mission because the turning
          radius was as expected and as other systems like manual control,
          Return to Launch and live stream of data to ground station worked
          perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, despite everything, the drone was able to meet all the established
          requirements and have its systems installed and ready for flight on
          the day of the mission. And, although it was not able to perform the
          mission completely, all the analysis of telemetry data and its close
          value to the calculated ones suggest that, finally, it would have been
          able to fulfill the mission without any problem if it had not been for
          the failure of the engine support.
