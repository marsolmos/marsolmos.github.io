          The project of projects. The main showcase of your projects and your
          capabilities: a portfolio. Nowadays, skills-based teaching is being
          more and more displaced by project-based teaching. Real case studies
          in which you can demonstrate your skills as an engineer, designer or,
          in this case, data scientist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript based adaptation
          of a multitude of web-based templates and portfolios, adapted to the
          basic needs of a Data Science portfolio. It includes an attractive
          and modern design, is totally responsive, and incorporates the main
          sections needed for a portfolio: <i>Home, About me, Experience,
          Education, Skills, Projects, Resume and Contact.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, this portfolio is hosted through GitHub Pages, allowing
          free web hosting and a seamless integration, as you can imagine, with
          GitHub for version control.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the code <a href="https://github.com/marsolmos/marsolmos.github.io">
          is published on GitHub</a> and is available for anyone to use to
          create their own portfolio.
        </p>
        <h3>Hosting on GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p>
          The procedure for creating a page in GitHub pages is extremely
          simple. You simply create a repository whose name is the same as the
          username you are creating the repository under, followed by
          <i>"github.io"</i>. That way, the repository name would look something
          like <i>"username.github.io"</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we've done this, we'll need to go to the <i>Settings</i> tab of our
          newly created repository and click on enable GitHub Pages. For more
          detailed information about the procedure for creating the GitHub
          Pages repository, you can consult the following
          <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/pages/">GitHub guide</a>
          or <a href="https://youtu.be/BA_c3bGQXlQ">this excellent tutorial</a>
          that will guide you step-by-step through the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          From now on, we will be able to commit to our repository and see the
          changes published on the site <i>"http://username.github.io"</i>
        </p>
        <h3>Custom domain on GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p>
          You can also customize your site's domain in GitHub Pages. And to do
          that, you'll need to own a custom domain first.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many trusted sites on the Internet where you can buy a
          custom domain name, such as <i>GoDaddy, Google Domains, Arsys,</i> etc.
          The price of a domain depends on the popularity of the domain, its
          extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.) and the website where you buy it.
          Domain offers are frequent, so it is interesting to visit several
          sites before buying one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we buy it, we will have to redirect the traffic of that domain
          to our GitHub site. To do this, first, in our GitHub repository,
          we'll add our custom domain in the <i>Settings / Custom domain</i> tab.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, we'll have to set up the <i>"A" records</i> of our DNS provider.
          The procedure to configure it will depend on our DNS provider, so
          you'll need to consult the relevant documentation for each case.
          For example, the procedure to configure them in a domain purchased
          in GoDaddy would be similar to the one shown in the
          <a href="https://youtu.be/g8kfAZOjgR0">following tutorial</a>.
