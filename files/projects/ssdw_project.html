        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>
          Starting 1996 student workshops with international participation were
          held at SSDW home campus, at the
          <i>Institute of Space Systems (IRS)</i> of the
          <i>University of Stuttgart</i>, as well as the
          <i>European Space Research</i> and <i>Technology Centre (ESTEC)</i>
          in Noordwijk, the Netherlands,
          <i>"Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Aéronautique et de l'Espace" (Supaero)</i> in
          Toulouse, France, at the <i>International Space University (ISU)</i> in
          Strasbourg, France, and at the <i>University of Sydney</i> in Sydney,
          Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          These workshops have the primary objectives of giving the
          participating students the opportunity to learn and practice systems
          engineering and design on a space related subject, to directly apply
          the knowledge acquired during the space station lectures and related
          lecture series, and to participate in an international and
          multidisciplinary team-based design project. As a consequence, the
          participants should not only be knowledgeable about space stations and
          human space exploration in general, but they are also expected to
          fully commit themselves to their tasks during the workshops, in order
          to play a valuable role in their respective design teams. Another
          important factor for the success of an integrated SSDW design team is
          that all members are open-minded towards other cultures and
          personalities. Social competence becomes as important as a good
          knowledge of technical issues.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>
          The tools used for the SSDW consist of custom-developed software
          dedicated to space mission conceptual design and simulation as well
          as commercially-available, general-purpose software. Together, they
          allow for intuitive development and iterative assessment of the space
          mission design.
        </p>
        <h3>SSDW Positions</h3>
        <p>
          Every team at SSDW is composed by specialists of different areas. All
          working together during a whole week to achieve the best possible
          design. Each team is composed by, at least, one of the following
          specialist:
        </p>
        <ul id="project-detail-list">
          <li>Attitude & Orbit Control</li>
          <li>Communication</li>
          <li>Electrical Power Systems</li>
          <li>Entry, Descent and Landing</li>
          <li>Human Factors</li>
          <li>Journalism</li>
          <li>Life Support Systems</li>
          <li>Mission Analysis</li>
          <li>Project Management</li>
          <li>Propulsion & Transport</li>
          <li>Radiation</li>
          <li>Robotics & EVA</li>
          <li>Structure & Aerodynamics</li>
          <li>Systems Engineering</li>
          <li>Thermal Control System</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2017 Edition</h3>
        <p>
          In the last years, the Space Station Design Workshop focused on
          mission concepts for a space station in cis-lunar space and feasible
          habitats on the lunar surface. In 2017 edition, two interdisciplinary
          teams composed of international students and young professionals,
          supported by experts from industries and universities, were challenged
          to investigate and evaluate different scenarios for a manned platform
          in the Martian system. Crucial criteria for the
          assessment were given, such as interests of leading space agencies,
          scientific output, public outreach, complexity and feasibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team purpose was focused on a permanent crewed base station on
          Mars Surface. Within a week, we desgined the whole mission. Some of
          the key-points of our design were:
        </p>
        <ul id="project-detail-list">
          <li>Radiation protection with water-filled walls in our base station</li>
          <li>Launch windows planned to always have, at least, 1 person living in the station</li>
          <li>Low budgeting thanks to international collaboration and technologies already developed</li>
          <li>Efficient Thermal and Electrical Power systems</li>
          <li>Automated construction of the base without human intervention</li>
        </ul>
