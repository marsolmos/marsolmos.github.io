        <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Future. The future sounds like something distant in time. However, it
          always reaches us ahead of schedule. Sometimes, even earlier than
          desired. Today, many large companies see the future of logistics in
          the delivery of parcels by means of drones. A future for which
          billions of dollars are being invested in R&D to develop drones with
          greater autonomy, load capacity and to detect obstacles along the
          way. A future for which, however, there is still no satisfactory
          solution to achieve it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strict regulations of air traffic control agencies do not allow
          drones to fly "freely", fully confident that their obstacle avoidance
          systems are enough to fly without human supervision in a populated
          environment such as a city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The big companies in the logistics sector continue to press for a
          future, full of drones delivering packages in our cities, to become a
          reality soon. However, none has yet been able to find a satisfactory
          method of delivery that is safe, economically efficient and can be
          implemented with current technology at the same time. With no need to
          pilot drones from the ground manually. With no need to develop new
          technologies... Until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer an end-to-end service to those companies who want to
          implement an ultra-express drone-based delivery service in urban
          areas. MAIVAULT aims to become the reference in the drone logistics
          sector, not only by reducing shipping costs and delivery time but
          also by decreasing pollution and road traffic in highly-populated
          cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our patented station is designed to operate in public spaces being
          able to house multiple parcels. Our stations network is supplied by
          an AI-powered fleet of long-range/high-speed drones capable of
          carrying a wide variety of packages to our customers in a fast and
          safe way. With the disposal of a fleet management real-time control
          structure, a viable commercial airspace can be easily implemented for
          the fulfillment of our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          MAIVAULT stations have multiple systems, designed with great care to
          detail, to allow the reception, accommodation and delivery of
          packages at all times. That is why their maintenance is a crucial
          aspect for their safe and efficient operation, without which their
          use should not be allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Income is generated by means of the same concept as in traditional
          delivery companies. Depending on the distance between the shipping
          direction and the MAIVAULT station, a shipping fee is determined.
          However, in contrast with other delivery systems neither weight nor
          volume influences the cost of the delivery while the package
          accomplishes the drone capacity constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do all this, there is a team behind highly motivated and
          committed to the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MAIVAULT team is composed of two Aerospace Engineers from the
          Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. Given their training they
          know first-hand the drone sector, its advantages and the problems it
          faces in its development.  Passionate about new technologies and
          their ability to improve the world, they have put all their effort
          and experience in developing a viable solution to the problem of air
          delivery. It is in this environment where MAIVAULT was born.
          With the desire to become a reference. With the dynamism and
          freshness of a young team. With the conviction that tomorrow
          can be better.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in order to make this future a reality, the development
          team requires an initial investment. Purchases of components,
          employee salaries, taxes… All of them, leading to the same result:
          270,000 €. A high amount that, nevertheless, would be able to be
          returned in its entirety at the end of the third year after the
          implementation of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that this amount can be returned in just three years is just
          one small example of why we firmly believe this business will be a
          success. Its innovative approach, low operating cost, and high
          revenues once the initial investment in the stations has been
          amortized allow for a high annual return.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, it is a system that allows to please all the players of
          the sector. Both the customer, by reducing delivery times and costs
          (even generating net profits in the latter), and the aeronautical
          authorities. The pressures to develop secure systems that do not
          invade the privacy of people on the ground are increasing, and
          current systems are not able to offer a fully satisfactory solution.
          However, following the same approach and the lessons learned in the
          civil commercial aviation sector over the last 50 years, MAIVAULT
          aims to make this future a reality. Make it the present. A present
          safe for all.
