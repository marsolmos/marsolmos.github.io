Welcome to my personal data science portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and achievements in data science.

## About

This portfolio highlights my journey and work in data science. It includes various projects that demonstrate my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects featured in my portfolio:

- **Plantabit**: A Telegram bot that reminds users to irrigate their plants based on species-specific needs (and also my Master Thesis ðŸ˜‰).
- **GTAutoDrive**: A Python-based project for autonomous driving simulations in GTA V.
- **CarGen**: A GAN-based car image generator.
- **GPT-2 Text Generator**: A text generation model using GPT-2, implemented on Google Cloud.
- **Video Games Sales EDA**: An exploratory data analysis project on video game sales.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

I chose to build this portfolio using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deepen my understanding of these fundamental web technologies. By avoiding frameworks, I gained hands-on experience with the core concepts and intricacies of web development, which has enhanced my skills and knowledge in creating responsive and interactive web pages from scratch.

## Deployment

This site is continuously deployed using GitHub Pages.
